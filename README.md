# slim-payum
Example of payum with Slim3.  Below describes the process we took in developing this demo.

0.1.0
- demonstrates omnipay_authorizenet_aim

0.1.1
- demonstrating how to add omnipay_firstdata_payeezy
At the time, omnipay/omnipay does not reference firstdata_payeezy so we manually add it.  This mean that we have to remove reference from omnipay/omnipay, update composer.json to match, and create custom PayumBuilder to include the new payment type.

## Goals
To create a simple API endpoint for charging credit cards.

1) It should not persist anything.

2) All configurations should be passed to the API via POST.

3) Project is setup as skeleton so that it can easily convert to persist data. 

4) Deploy anywhere: cpanel, docker, etc...

## Benefits
1) Secure since we do not store anything?

2) Micro-service style/architecture.

3) Easy to add new payment gateways provided by Payum and Omnipay.


## Cons
1) Add another layer of complexity?  This code provide a good starting point/example.  For better flexibility, developer can use it as example to implement payment directly into their own framework.

2) Anytime there is a new network layer, there is a possibility of man-in-the-middle attack.  This kind of service should run behind SSL in Production.  It's easy to obtain cheap or free SSL these day with service such as https://letsencrypt.org/

# Example

## OMNIPAY - AuthorizeNet - AIM
Before you start, signup and obtain a sandbox account with AuthorizeNet: https://developer.authorize.net/

Login to the console and obtain an apiLoginId and transactionKey.

### POST
```
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8888/api/payment/charge -d  '{
    "gateway": {
        "gatewayName": "test",
        "factoryName": "omnipay_authorizenet_aim",
        "config": {
            "apiLoginId": "xxx",
            "transactionKey": "yyy",
            "sandbox": true,
            "testMode": true,
            "developerMode": true
        }
    },
    "order": {
        "amount": 123.00,
        "currency": "USD",
        "card": {
            "number": "5424000000000015",
            "expiryMonth": "12",

            "cvv": "999"
        }
    }
}'
```

### Result
